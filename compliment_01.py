'''

1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?

5


2. What was the hardest part of this lab?

Having no starting code right off the bat definitely made it a lot harder than all the previous labs.
A lot more trial and error and mistakes made along the way when the training wheels come off.
